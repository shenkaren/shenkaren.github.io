#### Preface
Before college, the only exposure to art I had was through curriculum requirements throughout grade school. I definitely enjoyed them, but did not dive any further than those general classes that everyone had to take, since my free time was spent on piano and flute. 

#### The Awakening
Around college, bullet journaling videos started appearing on my YouTube recommended. I subscribed to channels like AmandaRachLee and put my 'creative' energy into spreads I had adapted from these tutorials to meet my study needs. With no surprise, by the end of the month, I'd look back and realize my spreads were half empty. I would skip months and just make spreads during breaks or if I just really liked the theme that month. Some of my favorites included holiday ornaments, lofi study, and avatar.

With the onset of quarantine and me moving out to Seattle, I suddenly had more time and independence to pursue hobbies. I picked up an iPad for the sake of taking notes, making to do lists, etc. and for ebooks, since I had virtually no notebooks, books, or any access to a library. I remembered seeing tutorials here and there of people using Procreate for digital art, so I got it for fun. It was just $9.99 and I had no art supplies except for some colored sharpies, so I figured why not.

Wow what a **GAMECHANGER**. My eyes were opened to an immense amount of possibilities with all the brush options, layers, drag and drop fill, exact color matching, and the ever so powerful *undo*. The preset brushes go beyond simulating pencils and paints - there are brushes that mimic light, water, leaves, crystals, and more. You can import reference images. It made art for a hobbyist like me so much more accessible. 

#### Minimalist Phase Begins

From here, I started recreating scenes from my favorite shows like Avatar the Last Airbender and It's Okay to Not Be Okay by tracing over frames from the shows and color filling to achieve a minimalst look. The minimalist look was more of a result of being the flattest learning curve for a beginner like me than a very intentional aesthetic. I was still not familiar with how to add texture and lighting with the different brushes, so color fill was the easiest technique. That being said, it was still challenging to build intuition and skill to distill a photo into a handful of color blocks that still capture the essence of the original.

Over time, the shading became more natural and I learned to make the lines more crisp. At this point, after the encouragement of some good friends, I started posting my pieces on an art Instagram account. I was just happy to have a digital log of my art experiments that I could also share with my friends. Big wholesome energy back then. I also viewed my pieces as 'experiments' as opposed to actual art, since I was using layers to trace over original frames. A bit of my subconscious was feeling guilty that I was not truly bringing any ingenuity. And turning live action scenes into 'art' was not the most fulfilling since it was harder to nail down the correct shading. Anime scenes already have guidance with how they're lined and colored. 

In this stage, I was still outlining everything in black ink and did not have a consistent theme other than blank faces with some defining brows. The only piece from this stage that I am still very proud of today is the Firebending Masters scene because I had 'painted' the background myself and really liked how the colors were able to blend together. I even turned the design into a sticker, but the sticker shop will be another segment of this series. 

#### Turning Point
Around October 2020, I had picked up Naruto and I was waist deep in the fandom and wanted to make some of my own pieces. Most of the anime fanart world is very pencil and line based, so I thought my minimalist approach would offer a somewhat fresh perspective. During my brief online searches of existing minimalist Naruto artwork, I found that with many wallpapers, the outlines were not black, but instead the color of the edge. I applied this to my draft in progress of Naruto with the three sensei he had throughout his life (i.e. eating ramen with Iruka, upgrading his fit with Jiraiya, and getting a piggyback ride from Kakashi). This method instantly leveled up my art, so I dove into this further. 

From my [gallery](/gallery), you can see my Uchiha trilogy. Out of these three, my favorite (and probably one of my favorite pieces of ***ALL TIME***) is Itachi. I took inspiration from some wallpapers I had seen where his cloak disintegrates into crows. I wanted to take this genjutsu illusion to the next level by arranging the crows such that they would fly in a formation surrounding the Uchiha clan symbol. Without the harsh black outlines, the crows blend *seamlessly* into his cloak. One of the most challenging parts of this was actually the face and hand. In the minimalist style, it is tricky to bring definition within a segment where everything is still the same color (e.g. fingers and nose overlaid on the face), but I think I was still mostly able to achieve the effect. 

I reached the threshold of originality that I was proud of, so after the encouragement of my friend, I posted my Naruto pieces on the Naruto subreddit. The Uchiha brothers performed very well and Itachi smashed it out of the ballpark with 1.1k+ upvotes. More into the numbers game struggle later... Seeing this online success with strangers, I had accumulated enough confidence to turn my designs into products I could sell. I started with digital downloads and then branched into stickers.
