#### Motivation
Around the time I started my minimalist art phase, I came across fellow accounts with art shops on YouTube, Instagram, Reddit, etc. I saw there was a market for minimalist content and potentially other themes (e.g. women in tech, anime, Netflix shows) that aligned with the designs I enjoyed creating. During this time, I also loved watching studio vlogs where people showed them running their sticker shops, packaging orders, and creating more art. They were so inspiring to watch and I wanted to experience it myself. 

While becoming a founder of a start-up has never been a priority for me, entrepreneurship and learning about the stories of founders has always been super interesting to me. I had taken an engineering entrepreneurship class in college and subscribe to a couple business related podcasts like How I Built This, Business Wars, and Snacks Daily. Running a small shop seemed like a fun thing to try out without much cost. 

Platform-wise, I actually briefly considered Redbubble first since they have built in pipelines that take the image you upload to manufacturers to produce into whatever products you want including stickers, prints, shirts, and more. That being said, there were some issues I read about involving how they collect sales tax and there was no quality control from my standpoint that I could ensure on the manufacturers that Redbubble chose, which was a bit unsettling to me. I decided Etsy would be a happy medium between Redbubble vs. running a shop mostly by myself using something like Shopify or Squarespace. Without a major following for my shop, I assumed the Etsy SEO (search engine optimization) would help my products get discovered by new customers (which has been confirmed so far in my experience) and IMO worth the cut they take. If I eventually get more of my own following, I might consider moving to building my own shop with an ecommerce service. 

#### Digital Downloads
My first offering was digital downloads since I did not have to order inventory ahead of time from a manufacturer or invest in a bunch of equipment and materials to make phyical products yourself. I wanted to get the hang of Etsy's UI and selling platform, so I started with some downloadable wallpapers for phone and laptop backgrounds. I got a bit of support from friends and a few strangers, but traction was pretty low overall. I was not that surprised since there is an abundant supply of free aesthetic wallpapers online. Another major benefit of this venture was getting an inside look at analytics when it came to I knew that turning my designs into physical, tangible products would more fulfilling to me. 

#### Stickers
Luckily I had some experience with ordering stickers when I was in charge of ordering club merch in my college's SWE chapter, so I knew a good manufacturer to begin with. I did some additional research and found another printing shop, so everytime I placed an order I just checked which ever place had a better promotion at the time. 

The first sticker I ordered was of the Itachi design since I wanted to see how it would perform on clear vinyl, but I forgot to take into account that without a background color layer, the Uchiha clan symbol behind Itachi would be super faint... Major oops, but I learned from that it would be safer to go with the classic vinyl where the background / cutline is white. With my learnings, I ordered the Penn sticker sheet and vscode girl sticker. I went with these first since they had the least existing competition on Etsy (compared to stickers of popular shows like The Queen's Gambit) and at the time I thought would not be as affected by timely trends. 

I released two more lines so far: shows (Start-up K-Drama, Bridgerton, and Avatar the Last Airbender) and punny animal friends. More on the animal friends line in another art journey post.

#### Packaging
One of the exciting aspects of selling physical products is getting to package and mail out the orders. I had bought some prints myself from other smol shops, so I knew the etiquette was to wrap everything nicely, use hella cute washi tape, leave a personalized note, and handletter the customer's name on the envelope, etc. As a customer, I appreciated all these details in my orders, so I tried to emulate that experience of opening up a gift (even if it's just for yourself haha) in my packaging. 

#### Marketing
Possibly the most time-consuming part is not setting up the actual shop or packaging orders, but actually marketing my content. I have mostly been promoting my art and shop updates on Instagram, Reddit, Tiktok, and Facebook specifically for the Penn sticker pack. It involves some time to take photos/videos for posts and stories, create captions, pick the right hashtags, etc. and even if some posts get quite a bit of engagement, the conversion rate to actual Etsy purchases is very low. So far it seems that the Penn sticker pack had the most success via social media promo, but that would make sense with the nature of how niche it is. The other show based ones have had some mild success from Reddit and Etsy SEO. 

Then there is the issue of timing. I had expected the vscode girl sticker to perform better, but I did not properly account for the fact that while hydroflasks themselves are still widely used, the vsco girl meme hass died out a couple years ago... With the Penn sticker pack, many of the references were unrelatable to current freshmen since the pandemic completely cut off BYO culture, GSR bookings, Distrito, etc. Had I come up with this idea when I was still on campus, I could have easily promoted at events in person as well. And finally the main issue of creating content based on shows, is that if you are late, there is a lot of competition that sprouts up and event worse, the show itself may lose popularity. The end of Start-up was losing steam, so while competition was pretty light, the demand was smaller than I had hoped and Bridgerton's longetivity was just a few months. I am aiming to make some more timeless pieces in the future to mitigate these issues. 

#### Next Steps
As I am writing this piece, a few Attack on Titan prints I designed are on their way, so we shall see how selling prints goes. I also need to work on branding - business and/or thank you cards, logos, banners, etc. This part has been trickier than I expected since I am still trying to figure out my art aesthetic and style. And of course focusing on learning new art techniques.
