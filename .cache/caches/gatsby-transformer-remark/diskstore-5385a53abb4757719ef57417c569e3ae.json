During this time, I also loved watching studio vlogs where people showed them running their sticker shops, packaging orders, and creating more art. They were so inspiring to watch and I wanted to experience it myself.

That being said, there were some issues I read about involving how they collect sales tax and there was no quality control from my standpoint that I could ensure on the manufacturers that Redbubble chose, which was a bit unsettling to me. I decided Etsy would be a happy medium between Redbubble vs. running a shop mostly by myself using something like Shopify or Squarespace. Without a major following for my shop, I assumed the Etsy SEO (search engine optimization) would help my products get discovered by new customers (which has been confirmed so far in my experience) and IMO worth the cut they take.

And finally the main issue of creating content based on shows, is that if you are late, there is a lot of competition that sprouts up and event worse, the show itself may lose popularity.
